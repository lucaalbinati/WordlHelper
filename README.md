### Examples

In this example, we know what the first letter is (A) and we know several letters that aren't in the correct positions (L, O and T).
We use the wildcards to filter for words that start with A, have either an L or T in the second place, any letter in the third place, an unused letter in the fourth place, and finally either an L or T in the last place.
This yields a list of 7 words, including ALOFT, which is the correct answer.
